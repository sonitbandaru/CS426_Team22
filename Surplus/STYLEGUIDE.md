This document standardizes all of the visual components that will be used across the project. 
We want to make our code and UI is easy to collaborate and easy to use. 

## Color Scheme

- Button background: `#9b755c` muted brown
- Text: `#333333` Grey
- Links (Home): `white` for contrast on darker backgrounds

## Fonts + layout

- Font family: Noto Sans
- Base size: 20px
- Line height: 1.5
- All text is center-aligned by default.
- Buttons and nav links have rounded corners and bolded text

## Accessibility

- Font sizes are big enough to ensure people can read very easily
- Colors between background and text are different to increase contrast + boost visibility
- Buttons use `cursor: pointer` so people know it is clickable.
- Images have accessibility alt text
