      <p>This is the homepage.
      Surplus + combats food waste and food insecurity by connecting surplus food
    from dining halls and restaurants with local volunteers who deliver it to shelters 
    and those in need. Surplus+ will essentially serve as a central hub for volunteers,
     university staff and businesses to coordinate the pick up and drop off of food that 
     was intended to be wasted. UMass alone wastes 2.4 million lbs of food annually.
      The affliction of food insecurity in developed nations is solvable, 
      We think this could be a good step in that direction!
